As part of Bluestamp Engineering 2023, I built a knee activity monitor. This monitor is a knee brace that the user wears that alerts the user of improper knee form when doing squats. It is equipped with a buzzer to alert the user and publishes information about the user's activity to a web dashboard. This repository includes code for my project and a website where I have recorded the detail process for my projects as well as videos, schematics, and pictures.
